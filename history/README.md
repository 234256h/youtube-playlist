# AI Planning Documents

This directory contains ephemeral planning and design documents created by AI assistants during development.

## Purpose

- Store temporary planning docs (PLAN.md, DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, etc.)
- Keep repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Preserve planning history for reference

## Usage

AI assistants should store all planning/design documents here unless explicitly asked to create them in the root directory.

**Only access these files when explicitly asked to review past planning.**
